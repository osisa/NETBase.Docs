## Set TestValues.cs properly

Make sure that your \src\osisa.Docs.Tests\TestInfrastructure\TestValues.cs file 
has its TestPath variable pointing to the \TestData\TestBin\ folder of the git repository.

This folder may be different of every machine.

## Tests failing?

AdditionallyTests in osisa.Docs.Tests may fail.
If this is the case, please delete the /TestData/TestBin folder and instead extract the included TestBin.zip file.

This workaround has worked in the past. We're not sure (yet) why the tests fail on some machines.
